He states headaches essentially start in left occipital triangle area as he points and I describe. He gets a slight aura of heaviness in his eyes at the very beginning before the occiput pain. Headache wraps around his skull in a vice-like manner until it settles behind the eyeballs. At that time he develops photophobia, occasionally gets nauseas but not always, he does become dizzy, and he will become moody when this happens. Now they are anywhere from once to three times per week. Duration can be 10 to 15 minutes for a fleeting one. Otherwise, it can be an all day affair headache. He uses Excedrin for headaches, works 50% of the time.

We were particulary interested in the reason why he was limited to daytime driving only. He related that such was due to glare. Said that this was a problem he had experienced to some degree before his injury. Now with limited vision, he states it is a bit worse. Veteran informed me that he did not have shades to wear to neutralize the glare. Described glare from car lights at night as being quite blinding initially.
